Let's break down your questions and go through the strategy, metrics, and implementation vision for your bot.

### 1. Metrics that will fit your bot
Here are potential metrics you might want to consider, focusing on both board state and individual piece evaluations:

- **Piece mobility**: Number of squares each piece can move to. (Mobility bonuses)
- **Attacked squares**: Number of squares a piece attacks, and how critical they are.
- **Threatened pieces**: Evaluation of the pieces attacking or threatened, including potential exchanges.
- **King safety**: Measures to avoid exposing the king.
- **Material**: The basic count of remaining pieces, adjusted dynamically based on position.
- **Piece activity**: How active each piece is (e.g., a rook on an open file vs. a passive rook).
- **Center control**: Control of the center of the board or critical spaces. (Dynamic based on the shifting center concept).
- **Piece value scaling**: Adjusting piece value based on the game phase (e.g., pawns becoming more valuable in the endgame).
- **Passed pawns**: Bonus for passed pawns, especially when they are near promotion.
- **Pawn structure**: Bonuses for good pawn structure, penalties for doubled pawns, isolated pawns, etc.
- **King danger level**: Evaluating if the king is in check, the number of potential threats, etc.
- **Open files & diagonals**: Rooks and bishops on open files or diagonals should receive bonuses.
- **Piece coordination**: How well pieces support each other.
- **Defensive metrics**: Is a piece defended? How many attackers/defenders?

### 2. Evaluating board with multiple values per square
Visualizing metrics on a chessboard could be an excellent way to represent what's happening behind the scenes. You can visualize each square having values like:

- **How many pieces attack this square**
- **Defensive support for this square**
- **Potential tactical threats**

For visualization, Python alone might feel limited. If you’re okay branching out, you could explore **web-based frameworks** (e.g., JavaScript with D3.js or Three.js) for dynamic visualizations, or you could use **Unity or Godot** if you’re leaning towards 3D or more complex graphics. For simplicity, Python with a **Tkinter** GUI or **Pygame** is also an option, but I understand if you're not satisfied with PIL-based visuals.

### 3. Logic vs. Metrics on the Diagram
- **Metrics**: These are things like how many squares a piece attacks, material values, king safety, etc. These are relatively static unless recalculated.
- **Logic**: This is the process that uses metrics to make decisions. Logic includes things like choosing the best move based on metrics, avoiding exchanges unless favorable, minimizing king risk, etc.

### 4. Minimax for the opponent
Your plan for minimax makes sense, but limiting the depth and using it for fine-tuning decisions can work well in combination with real-time evaluation. It's less computationally expensive but ensures a reasonable evaluation of future moves.

                /           |          \                                      | - king_safety                 |

         +--------+    +----------+   +--------+ 
```

Here, the **ChessAgent** would query the **Board** for the position of all pieces. The **Metrics** module would store the current state of the game and each piece's influence, like attacked squares or king safety.

### 5. Example Metric Class in JSON
Here’s how we could store the data in a simplified JSON-like structure for one piece:

```json
{
  "Rook1": {
    "position": "a1",
    "attacked_squares": ["a2", "a3", "a4", "a5"],
    "mobility": 5,
    "defending": ["Pawn b2"],
    "threatened_by": {
      "Bishop": {
        "position": "c3",
        "attacking_squares": ["a1", "b2"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This structure could be centrally stored in a `Metrics` class that updates after each move.

### 6. Attacking Potential and Long/Short Term Perspectives
The logic behind long-term vs. short-term evaluations for each piece is interesting:

- **Short-term**: How many squares the piece can control or attack in the next move.
- **Long-term**: How many squares the piece can influence after a sequence of moves (i.e., future mobility).

Rook1 and Rook8 might both attack several squares now, but if Rook8 controls an open file or is involved in future exchanges, it could have a better long-term impact.

### Your Next Steps:
1. **Centralized Metrics**: Each piece will calculate values like attacked squares and store them in a central location accessible to the agent.
2. **Dynamic Strategy**: A more sophisticated agent will track metrics and adjust dynamically based on the game state.
3. **Logic Sorting**: I can sort your list of logic ideas into appropriate categories (metrics, strategies, decision-making) next.
