### **Centralizing Metrics: Diagram/Chart**
To centralize the metrics for your chess bot, we can follow a structured approach where pieces gather their own data and report it to a centralized system. Here's a conceptual diagram to demonstrate how the metrics flow:

```
+------------------------+            +--------------------------+
|        ChessAgent       |<-----------|     Central Metrics      |
|                        |            +--------------------------+
|  - Decides best move    |                     |
|  - Evaluates metrics    |                     |
+------------------------+                     v
              ^                               +-----------------+
              |                               | Metrics Manager  |
              |                               +-----------------+
              v                                      |
     +------------------+                            v
     | Piece (Rook, etc) |---calculates-------> +-----------------+
     +------------------+                       | AttackedSquares |
         ^        ^  ^                           +-----------------+
         |        |  |                                 |
         |        |  |                                 v
    +--------------------+                   +-------------------+
    | calculate_mobility()|                   |  Piece-Metrics    |
    +--------------------+                   +-------------------+
               .                                       .
               .                                       .
               .                                       .
```

#### **Explanation of Data Flow:**
- **ChessAgent**: Central entity that gathers and evaluates metrics for decision-making.
- **Piece (Rook, Bishop, etc.)**: Each piece calculates specific metrics (like attacked squares, mobility) and sends the data to the **Central Metrics**.
- **Metrics Manager**: Central hub that collects all data from pieces, organizes them into a structure (like JSON), and feeds them back to the **ChessAgent** for analysis.
- **AttackedSquares**: An example metric container that stores which squares are attacked and defended by each piece.
- **Piece-Metrics**: Store individual piece's detailed data like mobility, threats, and current positioning.

### **Examples of Methods for Centralized Metrics**

#### 1. **`calculate_attacked_squares()`**
- **Purpose**: Each piece calculates which squares it is currently attacking.
- **Where**: Implemented inside each specific piece class (e.g., Rook, Bishop) and feeds data to **Metrics Manager**.
  
#### 2. **`calculate_mobility()`**
- **Purpose**: Determines how many squares a piece can move to at any given time (mobility bonus).
- **Where**: Calculated by each piece and stored in **Central Metrics** for evaluation.
  
#### 3. **`evaluate_position()`**
- **Purpose**: Evaluates the overall value of a piece's current position based on central criteria like attacked squares, threats, and control.
- **Where**: **ChessAgent** pulls from centralized data and determines the score for the current game state.

#### Upper-level methods:
- **`evaluate_board()` (ChessAgent)**: Uses data from the **Metrics Manager** to evaluate the state of the board, including overall mobility, attacking potential, and threats.
- **`find_best_move()` (ChessAgent)**: After gathering metrics from the **Metrics Manager**, this method applies game logic (like minimax or pruning) to decide on the best move.

### **Sorting and Structuring the Logic**
Hereâ€™s how I would organize your list of bot functionalities into methods, metrics, and logic.

#### **1. Weight Table for Middle- & Endgame (Texel Tuner)**
- **Category**: Strategy/Algorithm
- **Implementation**: Create a **WeightTable** class that dynamically updates values for pieces based on the game phase. Use Texel tuning data to evaluate whether a move benefits long-term strategy.

```python
class WeightTable:
    def __init__(self):
        self.middle_game_weights = {...}
        self.end_game_weights = {...}
    
    def get_weight_for_piece(self, piece_type, game_phase):
        if game_phase == 'middle':
            return self.middle_game_weights[piece_type]
        else:
            return self.end_game_weights[piece_type]
```

#### **2. Score Position Before/After Move**
- **Category**: Metric
- **Implementation**: Store the board evaluation before and after each move to assess if it improves the position.
- **Example Method**:
```python
def score_position_before_move(self, position):
    return self.evaluate_position(position)

def score_position_after_move(self, new_position):
    return self.evaluate_position(new_position)
```

#### **3. Penalty for Putting Piece Under Attack**
- **Category**: Metric/Logic
- **Implementation**: Create a `penalty_under_attack()` method in the **Metrics Manager**. This evaluates if a piece is placed in a threatened position and applies a penalty score.

```python
def penalty_under_attack(piece_position):
    if piece_position in threatened_squares:
        return -50
    return 0
```

#### **4. MCTS/Minimax Approach**
- **Category**: Search/Logic
- **Implementation**: Implement **Minimax** or **MCTS** (Monte Carlo Tree Search) as a search strategy to explore future moves.
- **Example Method**:
```python
def minimax_search(self, depth, maximizing_player):
    # Perform minimax logic here
    return best_move
```

#### **5. Mobility Bonus**
- **Category**: Metric
- **Implementation**: **calculate_mobility()** should count how many squares a piece can move to and give a bonus if the piece is highly mobile.

```python
def calculate_mobility(self):
    return len(self.attacked_squares)
```

#### **6. Principal Variation Search**
- **Category**: Search Algorithm
- **Implementation**: Use this method as a search heuristic for speeding up move evaluation.
- **Example Method**:
```python
def principal_variation_search(self):
    # Logic for principal variation
    return best_move
```

#### **7. Null Move Pruning**
- **Category**: Search Optimization
- **Implementation**: Implement as an advanced pruning technique in your search algorithms.

```python
def null_move_pruning(self, depth, board):
    # Skip null moves in certain conditions to prune the search tree
    return result
```

#### **8. Total Mobility Percentage**
- **Category**: Metric
- **Implementation**: Calculate the percentage of total mobility for each piece compared to all pieces, to guide decisions.
- **Example Method**:
```python
def total_mobility_percentage(self, total_board_mobility):
    return (self.mobility / total_board_mobility) * 100
```

---

### **Questions and Clarifications**
1. **Weight Table for Middle-End Game**: How deep should we integrate Texel tuning? Should it apply to all phases, or is the focus on only middle and endgame?
2. **Principal Variation Search**: Should this be the primary search method or an auxiliary one to complement minimax?
3. **Threatened Pieces**: For calculating threats, should we consider only direct attacks, or do we also count potential threats like pieces that could attack next turn?
4. **Mobility Bonus**: How heavily should mobility be weighted in comparison to other metrics like piece safety or material advantage?

Let me know how you feel about the structure and the direction we are moving towards! Your list is solid, but we can refine certain aspects further to fit the centralized metrics and dynamic strategy implementation.
